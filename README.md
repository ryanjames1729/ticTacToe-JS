# ticTacToe-JS

I made this tic tac toe after playing numerous games with my children while waiting for food in restaurants. The 2 player version is that version. The easy mode plays a computer that will randomly pick open squares which is why its easy. The harder version implements a version of the MiniMax Algorithm where the computer tries to find the position that will give it the best result. The hard version is unbeatable since the computer will always go first.
